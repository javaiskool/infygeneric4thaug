insert into empdetails (empid,empname,salary) select empno,ename,sal from emp where job='ANALYST'

create table emp25 as select empno,ename,sal from emp 


****************DML command
**update

update => to modify data in existing tuples
it is also used for filling in some columns


update table_name set column1_name=value,column2_nam=values .... where condition/s

update emp25 set sal=1400 where ename='SMITH'  => the tuples satisfing the given condition will be considered for updating salary.


update emp25 set sal=1400 where sal<1000

update emp25 set sal=sal*10 => as where clause is not used update will consider all the tuples.


modify the table emp25 to store hra, da,pf,pt,net,gross salary values

alter table emp25 add (hra number(8,2),da number(8,2),pf number(6,2),pt number(6,2),gross number(12,2),net number(12,2))

update emp25 set hra=sal*0.2,da=sal*0.12,pf=sal*0.08,pt=400

update emp25 set gross=sal+hra+da, net=gross-(pf+pt)

update emp25 set net=gross-(pf+pt)


****delete 

delete => used to remove the tuples from the table. if where clause is not specified then delete statement will delete all the tuples from the table

delete from table_name where condition/s


create table try31 (id number,name varchar2(10),amt number(8,2))

insert into try31 values (101,'aaa',8900);
insert into try31 values (102,'vvv',6780);
insert into try31 values (103,'kkk',12500);
insert into try31 values (104,'eee',5490);
insert into try31 values (105,'sss',9999);


delete from try31 where id=101

delete from try31 where amt<8000 => will remove the tuples that satisfies the given condition/s from table try31

if delete includes tuples with column-values which are referred by child table then delete will give error.

if in child table while defining foreign key on delete cascade option is used then parant as well as child tuples are removed with delete statment


delete from try31 => will remove all the tuples from table try31
