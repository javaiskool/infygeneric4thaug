2nd concept of programming
to alter the sequence of execution of the program or to skip the statment we use control structures

condition checking constructs

if (cond/s)
{
	true block
}

cond/s are prepared generally using relational operators
more than one conditions can be specified by using logical operators
if the cond/s result in true then the true block will be executed.

if (cond/s)
{
	true block
}
else
{
	false block
}

if cond/s evaluates to true then true block gets executed, then false block is skipped and the execution continues with statements after false block.
if cond/s evaluates to false then false block gets executed, then true block is skipped and the execution continues with statements after condition block

multiple conditions can be specified one after the other. it is called as multiple if
if (cond/s)
{

	true block
}
if (cond/s)
{
	true block
}


nested if blocks also can be used.
if (cond/s)
{
 	---
	---
	if (cond/s)
	{
		---
		---
	}
	else
	{
		-----
		----
	}
	-----
	----
}
else
{
 	---
	---
	if (cond/s)
	{
		---
		---
	}
	else
	{
		-----
		----
	}
	-----
	----
}


switch - case
whenever the execution of statements is about selecting one of the given options or the question has the answer that is to be selected from given list of answers then switch-case can be used for condition checking
syntax

switch (exp/var)
{
	case value1: statements;
			break;
	case value2: statements;
			break;
	default : statements;
}
switch can beused only with char,string,integral datatypes.

3rd concept of programming
control structure iteration 
repeated execution of set of statements
implemented by looping constructs
3 constructs => for loop, while loop, do while loop
repeataion is based on stopping condition
2 types => when no. of times the statements to be repeated is known use for loop
when how many times to repeate set of statements is not known use while loop, do while
do while loop executes once and then checks the condition that determines whether to continue execution of the loop or not.
while loop is called entry controlled loop as it checks the condition then then if the condition is satisfied it starts the iteration.


for (start value;stopping condition;increment/decrement)
{
	
}
for(i=1;i<5;i=i+1)
{

}
i=1;
for(;;;)
{
	if(i>5) break;
	i=i+1;
}
	
while(condition)
{
  
statement which make the condition false after finite iterations

}

do
{

statement which make the condition false after finite iterations


}while(condition);

break statement => when inside a loop break statement is encountered, then the loop execution will terminate and program execution continues after loop.
continue statement => when inside a loop continue statement is encountered,then statements after continue in the loop block are skipped and the execution starts with new iteration of the loop.

nested loops => a type of loop can be nested with any type of loop
for loops are closely associated with arrays and nested for loops with multi-dimensional arrays.
