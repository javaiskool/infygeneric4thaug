** polymorphism
poly => many
morph => forms
in OOP the ability of an object to take multiple forms is called polymorphism

** static polymorphism => method overloading
making payments in different ways
payment by cash => note, denomination
paymentByCash(note, denomination)
payment by cheque => bankname,chequeno, date,amt
paymentByCheque(bankname,chequeno, date,amt)
payment by debit card => type, cardno,cvv no
paymentByDebitCard(type, cardno,cvv no)
payment by netbanking => bankname, ifsccode, accno,userid, pwd
paymentByNetBanking(bankname, ifsccode, accno,userid, pwd)


in a single class when a task can be performed in differnt multiple ways, it can be represented with common methodname and different parameterlist. these methods should have diffent parameter list i.e. number of parameters, datatype of parameters or sequence of parameters should be different. this is called as method overloading. method overloading is not recognized by difference in the return datatype specification

payment(note, denomination)
payment(bankname,chequeno, date,amt)
payment(type, cardno,cvvno)
payment(bankname, ifsccode, accno,userid, pwd)

binding of references and methods takes place at compile time. so it is also called as compile time binding/static polymorphism/early binding

constructor overloading is a special case of method overloading. in a class multiple constructors can be written with different paramerlist. 

** dynamic polymorphism => method overridding
